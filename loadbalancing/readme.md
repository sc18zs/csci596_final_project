This report analyzes the implementation of dynamic load balancing functionality in a parallel molecular dynamics simulation program using MPI (Message Passing Interface). The original code was enhanced to handle uneven particle distributions across processes.

Key Changes Overview:

- Added dynamic load balancing
- Modified process initialization
- Enhanced debugging/monitoring
- Added new configuration parameters
- Modified single_step() structure
